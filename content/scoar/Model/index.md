The SCOAR coupler is a flexible and efficient input-output file coupler, with a 2-D online smoothing implemented for interactive eddy filtering. The SCOAR source code is available through the Github repository: https://github.com/hyodae-seo/SCOAR <br>

The SCOAR regional coupled modeling system couples WRF, ROMS, and WW3 via COARE3.5 bulk flux algorithm implemented in WRF surface-layer module. WRF, ROMS, and WW3 codes are publically available model. <br>

WRF: https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF ; ROMS: https://github.com/kshedstrom/roms ; WW3: https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3
The SCOAR has been used to study the physics and impacts of air-sea-wave interactions in various regions; for the publication, please see https://hseo.whoi.edu/publications/. <br>
